## Canopy Stress Classification Using 3D Point Cloud

This repository accompanies the "Soybean Canopy Stress Classification Using 3D Point Cloud
Data" manuscript (MDPI Agronomy).  

 It provides code and resources to develop algorithms for assessing Iron Deficiency Chlorosis (IDC) stress severity in soybean plants using 3D RGB point cloud data captured by a Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS). The repository includes code for point cloud processing and analysis, a model development framework for IDC classification, and potentially a sample dataset.
